* Dot-Emacs
** Description
This is my personal Emacs configuration. It is obviously very personalised and
you'd be crazy to use it as-is.
** Installation
Requires GNU Make, curl and Git.

#+begin_src sh
cd
mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.backup
git clone git@github.com:chrisbarrett/dot-emacs.git .emacs.d
cd .emacs.d
make
#+end_src

Additional features can be installed using =make all=, or using the individual
tasks in the makefile (e.g. =make ruby=). I pretty much only test on my machine,
so YMMV.

The load sequence will search for a file called =personal-config.el=, which is a
good place to put things like your gnus server configuration, email address,
etc.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name    "Jane Coder"
      user-mail-address "foo@bar.com")

;; SMTP

(setq smtpmail-mail-address user-mail-address
      smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.foo.bar.com")

(provide 'personal-config)
#+end_src
